# AISearch Project Coding Standards

## TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Define types for all components, functions, and variables
- Avoid using 'any' type
- Use interfaces for objects with multiple properties

## Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable UI elements into separate components
- Use proper prop types with TypeScript interfaces

## Styling
- Use StyleSheet.create for all styles
- Follow the project theme definitions for colors, fonts, and spacing
- Keep styles organized by component or screen
- Use consistent naming conventions for style properties

## File Structure
- Group files by feature or domain
- Keep related files close to each other
- Use index files for cleaner imports
- Follow project folder structure guidelines

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names and files
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose

## Imports
- Group imports: React, libraries, components, utilities
- Use absolute imports for project files when possible
- Avoid duplicated imports

## State Management
- Use React hooks for local state
- Keep state as close as possible to where it's used
- Minimize prop drilling
- Use context or state management libraries for global state

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors for debugging purposes

## Performance
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Use callback functions properly
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize images and assets

## Documentation
- Add comments for complex logic
- Document component props and functions
- Keep README updated with project information
- Document any non-obvious implementations 

## Command Line & Environment (Windows)
- Use backslashes (\) for Windows file paths in commands
- Use 'cd' to navigate directories before executing commands
- Always verify current directory with 'dir' before installing packages
- Install all npm packages inside the AISearch directory, not the root
- Use npm commands without additional flags on Windows
- For directory navigation with spaces, use quotes: cd "My Folder"
- When in doubt about command syntax, use full paths
- Remember that Windows environment is case-insensitive but React Native is case-sensitive
